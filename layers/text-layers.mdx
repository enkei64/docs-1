Text layers (CATextLayer) display customizable text with support for system fonts, alignments, and wrapping.

## Creating a Text Layer

1. Click **Add Layer** in the Layers Panel.
2. Select **Text Layer**.
3. A new text layer will appear on your canvas.

---

## Text Properties

These properties are found in the **Text** tab of the Inspector Panel.

### Text Content
1. Double-click the text on the canvas OR select the layer and find the **Text** box in the Text tab.
2. Type your message.
3. Press **Enter** to commit or **Escape** to cancel.

### Font Family
1. Find the **Font** dropdown in the Text tab.
2. Select a font from the list. 
<Info>
  The canvas uses your browser's fonts. The final wallpaper will use the fonts available on your iOS device.
</Info>

### Font Size
1. Find **Font Size** in the Text tab.
2. Enter a pixel value. For headlines, try 48-72. For small labels, try 14-18.

### Text Color
1. Find **Color** in the Text tab.
2. Click the color picker to set the text's appearance.

### Alignment & Wrapping
- **Align**: Choose Left, Center, Right, or Justified.
- **Wrapped**: When enabled, text will automatically move to a new line if it hits the edge of the layer's width.

## Common Properties

Text layers support all standard properties in the **Geometry** and **Compositing** tabs.

### Geometry
- **Position (X, Y)**: Location on the canvas.
- **Bounds (W, H)**: The size of the text box. If **Wrapped** is on, the Width determines where lines break.
- **Rotation**: Rotate your text in 2D or 3D.

### Compositing
- **Opacity**: Fade your text from 0% to 100%.
- **Hidden**: Toggle visibility.

## Troubleshooting

### "My text is cut off"
**Solutions:**
- Increase the layer's **Width** or **Height** in the Geometry tab.
- Reduce the **Font Size**.
- Toggle **Wrapped** off if you want it all on one line.

### "I can't see my text"
**Check:**
- Is the text color the same as the background?
- Is the **Opacity** set to 0%?
- Is there actually text typed into the **Text** property?
