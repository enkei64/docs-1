## Creating an Image Layer

### Method 1: Local Files
1. Click **Add Layer** in the Layers Panel.
2. Select **Image Layer…**.
3. Choose one or more images from your computer.

### Method 2: Import from Link
1. Click **Add Layer** in the Layers Panel.
2. Select **Import from Link**.
3. Paste the URL of the image and click **Import**.

### Method 3: Drag and Drop
- Simply drag an image file from your computer directly onto the editor canvas.

<Info>

## Image Properties

These properties are found in the **Content** tab of the Inspector Panel.

### Fit Mode
Controls how the image fills the layer's bounds.
- **Cover**: Spans the entire layer, cropping the image if necessary.
- **Contain**: Shows the whole image, adding empty space if necessary.
- **Fill**: Stretches the image to fit exactly (may look distorted).
- **None**: Keeps the image at its original size.

## Editing Images

CAPlayground includes built-in tools for permanent image modifications. These tools create a new version of your image and replace the original in your project.

### Crop
The Crop tool allows you to select a specific portion of your image.
1. Select your image layer.
2. Go to the **Content** tab.
3. Click **Crop**.
4. Adjust the green selection handles to your desired area.
5. Choose **Maintain bounds after crop** if you want the layer to keep its current size on the canvas.
6. Click **Apply crop**.

### Permanent Blur
Use this to bake a blur effect directly into the image file.
1. Click **Blur** in the **Content** tab.
2. Adjust the **Blur Amount** slider.
3. Click **Apply Blur**.

<Tip>
  **Permanent vs. Dynamic Blur:** Use the **Blur Tool** for a permanent background effect (better performance). Use the **Filters Tab** for a blur that you want to animate over time.
</Tip>

### Reset Bounds
If you've resized your image layer and want it to return to its original width and height, click **Reset Bounds**.

---

## Filters (Dynamic Editing)

In the **Filters** tab, you can add non-destructive effects that can be adjusted or animated later.

- **Gaussian Blur**: A dynamic blur effect.
- **Contrast, Saturation, Sepia**: Traditional color adjustments.
- **Hue Rotate**: Shift all colors in the image.
- **Invert**: Flip the colors of the image.

## Common Properties

Image layers support all standard properties in the **Geometry** and **Compositing** tabs.

### Geometry
- **Position (X, Y)**: Location on the canvas.
- **Bounds (W, H)**: The size of the layer. Match this to your image's aspect ratio for the best look.
- **Rotation**: Rotate your image in 2D or 3D.

### Compositing
- **Opacity**: Adjust transparency from 0% to 100%.
- **Corner Radius**: Round the corners of your image to create circles or rounded frames.

---

## Best Practices

- **File Size**: Keep images under 2MB for faster loading and better performance.
- **Transparency**: Use PNGs with transparency for logos and icons.
- **Resolution**: Use images that match the resolution of your device for maximum sharpness.

## Troubleshooting

### "My image looks stretched"
**Solution:**
- Check your **Fit Mode**. Set it to **Cover** or **Contain** to maintain the correct aspect ratio.

### "I can't see my image"
**Check:**
- Is **Opacity** set to 0%?
- Is the layer hidden?
- Did the upload finish? Large files may take a moment to appear.
