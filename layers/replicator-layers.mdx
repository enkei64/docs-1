Replicator layers (CAReplicatorLayer) are powerful containers that duplicate their sublayers into multiple instances, applying cumulative transformations like translation, rotation, and scaling to each successive copy.

## Creating a Replicator Layer

1. Click **Add Layer** in the Layers Panel.
2. Select **Replicator Layer**.
3. A new replicator layer will be added. 

<Info>
  **Important:** Replicator layers work by duplicating their **sublayers**. You must add one or more layers inside the replicator layer to see any duplicated instances!

## Replicator Properties

These properties are found in the **Replicator** tab of the Inspector Panel when a replicator layer is selected.

### Instance Count
Controls how many total copies are rendered, including the original sublayers.
1. Find **Instance Count** in the Replicator tab.
2. Enter a value (e.g., 5 will create the original + 4 copies).

### Instance Translation (X, Y, Z)
The offset applied to each successive instance.
- **X/Y**: Moves each copy horizontally or vertically relative to the previous one.
- **Z**: Moves copies forward or backward in 3D space.

### Instance Rotation (Z, X, Y)
The rotation applied to each successive instance.
- **Z Rotation**: Useful for creating circular patterns or fans.
- **X/Y Rotation**: Useful for 3D spiraling effects.

### Instance Scale
The scale factor applied to each successive instance. Values less than 1.0 make each copy smaller, while values greater than 1.0 make them larger.

### Instance Delay
The time delay (in seconds) applied to animations of sublayers for each instance. This creates "follow-the-leader" or wave-like animation effects.

## Common Properties

Replicator layers support all standard layer properties in the **Geometry** and **Compositing** tabs, affecting the container as a whole.

### Geometry
- **Position (X, Y)**: Location of the entire replicator group.
- **Bounds (W, H)**: The size of the replicator container.
- **Anchor Point**: The point around which the translation/rotation offsets are calculated.

### Compositing
- **Opacity**: Fade the entire group of instances.
- **Hidden**: Hide all instances at once.
- **Preserves Depth**: (Advanced) Enabling this allows sublayers to maintain their 3D positions relative to each other.

## Tips & Tricks

### Creating a Grid
You can nest replicators! Put a "horizontal" replicator inside a "vertical" replicator to create a grid of elements.

### Circular Arrays
1. Set the **Instance Count** to the number of items you want in the circle.
2. Set the **Instance Rotation (Z)** to `360 / count`.
3. Adjust the sublayer's position relative to the replicator's center to set the radius.

## Troubleshooting

### "I only see one layer"
**Check:**
- Did you add sublayers *inside* the replicator layer?
- Is the **Instance Count** set to more than 1?
- Is the **Instance Translation** or **Instance Rotation** set to something other than 0? If they are 0, all copies are stacked exactly on top of each other.

### "Animations aren't offset"
**Check:**
- Did you set an **Instance Delay**?
- Are the animations applied to the sublayers *inside* the replicator, rather than the replicator itself?
