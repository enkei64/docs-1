Gradient layers (CAGradientLayer) display smooth transitions between multiple colors. They are ideal for backgrounds, lighting effects, and artistic color overlays.

## Creating a Gradient Layer

1. Click **Add Layer** in the Layers Panel.
2. Select **Gradient Layer**.
3. A new gradient layer will appear on your canvas.

## Gradient Properties

These properties are found in the **Gradient** tab of the Inspector Panel.

### Gradient Type
- **Axial (Linear)**: A straight-line transition between colors.
- **Radial**: A circular transition radiating from a center point.
- **Conic**: A 360-degree "color wheel" sweep around a center point.

### Colors Stops
You can add as many colors as you want to your gradient.
1. Find the **Colors** section in the Gradient tab.
2. Click **+ Add Color** to add a new stop.
3. Click the color indicator of a stop to change its color and transparency.
4. Click the **X** next to a stop to remove it.

### Start and End Points
These define the direction and spread of the gradient. 
- Points are defined as percentages (0% to 100%) of the layer's size.
- **Start (0%, 0%)** and **End (100%, 100%)** creates a diagonal gradient from top-left to bottom-right.
- For **Radial** gradients, the distance between the points determines the size of the circle.

## Common Properties

Gradient layers support all standard properties in the **Geometry** and **Compositing** tabs.

### Geometry
- **Position (X, Y)**: Location on the canvas.
- **Bounds (W, H)**: The size of the gradient.
- **Rotation**: Rotate the entire layer to change the gradient's angle.

### Compositing
- **Opacity**: Adjust the overall transparency of the gradient.
- **Corner Radius**: Round the corners of the gradient.

## Troubleshooting

### "My gradient isn't showing"
**Check:**
- Do you have at least two colors in the **Colors** section?
- Is the **Opacity** of the layer or the color stops set to 0%?
- Is the layer hidden?

### "The colors look banded"
**Solution:**
- Try adding more color stops with intermediate shades for a smoother transition.
