Basic layers (CALayer) are the most fundamental building blocks in CAPlayground. They are rectangular areas that can be styled with colors, borders, and rounded corners.

## Creating a Basic Layer

1. Click **Add Layer** in the Layers Panel.
2. Select **Basic Layer**.
3. A new rectangle will be added to your canvas (defaults to a blue square).

---

## Basic Properties

These properties are found in the **Content** and **Compositing** tabs of the Inspector Panel.

### Background Color
The internal fill color of the layer.
1. Find **Background Color** in the Content tab.
2. Click the color indicator to open the color picker.
3. Choose a solid color.

### Border
Adds an outline around the edge of the layer.
- **Border Color**: The color of the outline.
- **Border Width**: The thickness of the outline in pixels. Set to 0 to hide.

### Corner Radius
Rounds the corners of the layer.
1. Find **Corner Radius** in the Compositing tab.
2. Enter a pixel value (e.g., 10 for subtle rounding, or half the layer's width for a circle).

## Shaping Tips

While Basic Layers are rectangular by default, you can use **Corner Radius** to create different shapes:

- **Circle**: Set Width and Height to the same value, then set Corner Radius to half that value.
- **Pill**: Create a wide rectangle and set Corner Radius to half the height.
- **Containers**: Set the Background Color to transparent or Opacity to 0% to use the layer as an invisible folder for other sublayers.

## Common Properties

All layers share these standard properties in the **Geometry** and **Compositing** tabs.

### Geometry
- **Position (X, Y)**: Precise location on the canvas.
- **Bounds (W, H)**: Precise dimensions of the layer.
- **Anchor Point**: The pivot point for rotation (X: 0-1, Y: 0-1).
- **Rotation**: Rotate around X, Y, or Z axes.

### Compositing
- **Opacity**: Adjust overall transparency from 0% to 100%.
- **Hidden**: Toggle visibility in the editor and final wallpaper.
- **Masks to Bounds**: When enabled, any sublayers outside this layer's edges will be hidden (clipped).

## Troubleshooting

### "My circle is an oval"
**Check:**
- Ensure the **Width** and **Height** in the Geometry tab are exactly equal.

### "I can't see my layer"
**Check:**
- Is the **Background Color** same as the canvas background?
- Is **Opacity** set to 0%?
- Is the **Hidden** toggle enabled?
