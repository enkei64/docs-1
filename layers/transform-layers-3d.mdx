Transform layers (`CATransformLayer`) are special containers that allow their sublayers to exist in a true 3D space. While regular layers "flatten" their children into a 2D plane, a Transform Layer maintains the relative 3D depth and rotations of everything inside it.

<Info>
  Transform layers are primarily used for building 3D objects (like cubes) and creating advanced **Gyro Parallax** effects.

## 2D vs. 3D Behavior

To understand why you need a Transform Layer, compare how sublayers behave:

| Feature | Standard Layer | Transform Layer |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Flattening** | Flattens all children into the layer's own plane. | Preserves the 3D position of children. |
| **Depth (Z)** | Sublayers render based on list order (stacking). | Sublayers render based on their actual `zPosition`. |
| **Perspective** | Children look like flat stickers on a card. | Children tilt and rotate with realistic 3D perspective. |

## Building in 3D

You can use a Transform Layer as a "3D Scene" to construct complex objects. For example, to make a **Cube**:

1.  **Add a Transform Layer**: This acts as the "root" of your 3D object.
2.  **Add Sublayers (Faces)**: Add six Basic Layers inside the Transform Layer.
3.  **Position the Faces**:
    *   **Front/Back**: Give them a `zPosition` (e.g., `50` and `-50`).
    *   **Sides**: Rotate them 90° on the Y-axis (`rotationY = 90`) and move them out.
    *   **Top/Bottom**: Rotate them 90° on the X-axis (`rotationX = 90`) and move them up/down.
4.  **Rotate the Container**: Rotate the Transform Layer itself in the **Geometry** tab to see your object from different angles.

<Tip>
  When building 3D objects, use the **Inspector > Geometry** tab to precisely set `Rotation X`, `Rotation Y`, and `zPosition`.
</Tip>

## Interactions with Gyro

Transform layers are most powerful when combined with device motion. You can map the device's tilt to the rotation of a 3D container to create a realistic depth effect.

## Troubleshooting

### "My 3D object looks flat"
**Check:**
- Are your layers inside a **Transform Layer**? If they are inside a folder or a Basic Layer, they will be flattened.
- Did you set a **zPosition** or **Rotation X/Y** on the sublayers?

### "I don't see the Transform Layer option"
**Check:**
- Transform layers are specialized for gyro and 3D effects. Ensure your project has **Gyro** enabled in the project settings.
