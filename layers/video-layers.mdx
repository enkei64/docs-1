Video layers (CAKeyframeAnimation with CGImage contents) display animated videos and GIFs.

## Creating a Video Layer

### Method 1: Local Files
1. Click **Add Layer** in the Layers Panel.
2. Select **Video Layer…**.
3. Choose an MP4, MOV, or GIF file from your computer.

### Method 2: Import from Link
1. Click **Add Layer** in the Layers Panel.
2. Select **Import from Link**.
3. Paste the URL of the video/GIF and click **Import**.

<Info>
  **Note:** GIFs must be imported as Video Layers to maintain their animation. They will be automatically converted to frame-based animations.

## Video Properties

These properties are found in the **Video** tab of the Inspector Panel.

### Performance Limitations
To ensure your wallpaper runs smoothly on a mobile device:
- **Max Frame Rate**: 30 FPS.
- **Max Duration**: 12 seconds recommended.
- **Auto Reverses**: Toggle this to make the video play forward then backward for a seamless loop.

### Calculation Mode
Controls how frames transition:
- **Linear**: Smoothly blends between frames.
- **Discrete**: Sharp jumps between frames (useful for pixel art or stop-motion).

## Common Properties

Video layers support all standard properties in the **Geometry** and **Compositing** tabs.

### Geometry
- **Position (X, Y)**: Location on the canvas.
- **Bounds (W, H)**: Match this to your video's aspect ratio to avoid stretching.
- **Rotation**: Rotate your video in 2D or 3D.

### Compositing
- **Opacity**: Adjust transparency from 0% to 100%.
- **Corner Radius**: Round the corners of your video.

## Performance Warning

<Warning>
  Video layers are the most resource-intensive layer type. Using too many can drain battery or cause the wallpaper to lag. Use them sparingly!
</Warning>

---

## Troubleshooting

### "My video doesn't play"
**Check:**
- Is the file format supported? (MP4, MOV, GIF).
- Is the **Opacity** set to 0%?
- Try re-importing the file if the processing failed.

### "The video is stretched"
**Solution:**
- Adjust the **Width** and **Height** in the Geometry tab to match the original video's resolution.
