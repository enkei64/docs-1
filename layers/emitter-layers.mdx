title: "Emitter Layers"
description: "Complete guide to creating particle effects with emitter layers in CAPlayground."
---

Emitter layers (CAEmitterLayer) create complex particle effects like snow, rain, sparkles, and confetti. They work by emitting many small visual elements called particles based on the rules you define.

## Creating an Emitter Layer

1. Click **Add Layer** in the Layers Panel.
2. Select **Emitter Layer**.
3. A new emitter layer will appear on your canvas. Initially, it will be empty until you add **Emitter Cells**.

---

## Emitter Properties

These properties control the overall behavior of the particle system and are found in the **Emitter** tab.

### Emitter Position
The specific point where particles are created relative to the layer's bounds.
1. Find **Emitter Position** in the Emitter tab.
2. Adjust the X and Y coordinates to move the "mouth" of the emitter.

### Emitter Size
The dimensions of the emission area. A larger size spreads particles over a wider area.

### Emitter Shape
The shape of the emission area:
- **Point**: Emit from a single dot.
- **Line**: Emit along a horizontal or vertical line.
- **Rectangle**: Emit from a rectangular area.

### Emitter Mode
Controls how particles populate the chosen shape:
- **Volume**: Particles appear anywhere inside the shape.
- **Outline**: Particles appear only on the edges of the shape.
- **Surface**: Particles appear on the surface area.

### Render Mode
Controls how particles are drawn relative to each other:
- **Unordered**: Standard drawing.
- **Additive**: Particles glow when they overlap (excellent for fire or magic effects).

## Emitter Cells

Emitter cells define the appearance and behavior of the individual particles. You can add multiple cells to one emitter for complex effects (e.g., mixing rain and lightning).

### Adding a Cell
1. Select the Emitter layer.
2. In the **Emitter** tab, find the **Emitter Cells** section.
3. Click **+ Add Cell**.
4. Configure the cell properties in the expanded menu.

### Cell Properties
- **Birth Rate**: How many particles are created per second.
- **Lifetime**: How long each particle stays on screen (in seconds).
- **Velocity**: The speed at which particles are launched.
- **Scale**: The initial size of each particle.
- **Scale Range/Speed**: Randomness in size and how fast they grow or shrink.
- **Emission Range**: The angle (in degrees) at which particles are spread.
- **Spin**: How fast particles rotate as they move.
- **Acceleration (X/Y)**: Constant force applied to particles (useful for gravity or wind).
- **Alpha Speed**: How fast particles fade out over their lifetime.

## Common Properties

Emitter layers also support standard properties in the **Geometry** and **Compositing** tabs.

### Geometry
- **Position (X, Y)**: Move the entire emitter container.
- **Bounds (W, H)**: The overall size of the emitter layer.
- **Rotation**: Rotate the entire particle effect.

### Compositing
- **Opacity**: Fade all particles at once.
- **Hidden**: Toggle the entire effect on or off.

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't see any particles"
**Check:**
- Did you add an **Emitter Cell**?
- Is the **Birth Rate** greater than 0?
- Is the **Lifetime** greater than 0?
- Is the emitter layer hidden or at 0% opacity?

### "The particles move the wrong way"
**Solution:**
- Check the **Velocity** and **Acceleration** values.
- Adjust the **Emission Longitude** (direction) or **Emission Range**.

### "Performance is slow"
**Solution:**
- Reduce the **Birth Rate** or **Lifetime**. Too many particles on screen at once can impact performance.
- Test on a real device to see actual performance.
