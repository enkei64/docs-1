Liquid glass layers create a realistic glass distortion effect (refraction) that warps the layers behind them. 

<Warning>
  **Browser Compatibility:** This layer uses advanced CSS features that only work in **Chromium-based browsers** (Chrome, Edge, Opera). It will not be visible in Safari or Firefox in the editor, but it will work correctly once applied as a wallpaper on your device.
</Warning>

## Creating a Liquid Glass Layer

1. Click **Add Layer** in the Layers Panel.
2. Select **Liquid Glass Layer**.
3. A transparent distortion box will appear on your canvas.

## Liquid Glass Properties

These properties are found in the **Content** tab of the Inspector Panel.

### Strength
Controls how much the background is distorted. Higher values create more intense warping.

### Depth
Controls the perceived thickness of the glass. 

### Chromatic Aberration
Adds a color-fringing effect to the edges of the distortion, simulating how real glass prisms split light into colors.

---

## Common Properties

Liquid Glass layers support standard properties in the **Geometry** and **Compositing** tabs.

### Geometry
- **Position (X, Y)**: Location on the canvas.
- **Bounds (W, H)**: The size of the glass area.
- **Rotation**: Rotate the glass box.

### Compositing
- **Corner Radius**: Round the edges of the glass (e.g., to create a glass orb or pill).
- **Opacity**: Adjust the visibility of the distortion effect.

## Troubleshooting

### "I can't see anything"
**Check:**
- Are you using a Chromium-based browser (Chrome/Edge)?
- Is there something *behind* the glass layer? If the background is a solid color, the distortion might be hard to see. Place it over an image or text.
- Is **Strength** set to 0?

### "The effect is too strong"
**Solution:**
- Reduce the **Strength** and **Depth** values in the Content tab.
