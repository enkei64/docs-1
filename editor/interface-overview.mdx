---

The CAPlayground editor is designed to be intuitive and powerful. Understanding the interface will help you work more efficiently.

## Main Interface Areas

The editor is divided into four main areas:

- **Layers Panel** (left): Manage all your layers
- **Canvas** (center): Visual preview of your wallpaper
- **Inspector Panel** (right): Edit properties of selected layers
- **States Panel** (bottom left): Manage different device states (locked, unlocked, sleep)
- **Timeline Panel** (bottom): Visualize and adjust animations over time

### 1. Layers Panel (Left)

The Layers Panel is where you manage all the layers in your wallpaper.

**Features:**
- **Add Layer button**: Click to create new layers (Text, Basic, Gradient, Image, Video, Emitter, Transform)
- **Layer list**: Shows all layers in your project in a hierarchical tree
- **Layer actions**: Right-click or use the three-dot menu for options like Rename, Duplicate, Delete
- **Drag and drop**: Reorder layers by dragging them

<Info>
  Transform Layers are only available in gyro wallpaper projects and enable device tilt effects. [Learn more →](/layers/transform-layers)
</Info>

**Layer Indicators:**
- **Chevron icon** (▶/▼): Indicates a group layer with sublayers; click to expand/collapse
- **Green highlight**: Shows the currently selected layer
- **Layer name and type**: Each layer shows its name and type (e.g., "Basic Layer")

<Tip>
  Double-click a layer name to rename it. Good naming helps you stay organized!
</Tip>

### 2. Canvas (Center)

The Canvas is your visual workspace. It shows a real-time preview of your wallpaper exactly as it will appear on your device.

**Interacting with Layers:**
- **Selection**: Click any layer to select it. Clicking the empty canvas background will deselect all layers.
- **Movement**: Click and drag a layer to move it.
- **Resizing**: Use the selection handles. Hold **Shift** to lock aspect ratio, or **Alt/Option** to resize from the center.
- **Rotation**: Drag the rotation handle (the circle above the top-middle edge).
- **Context Menu**: **Right-click** any layer to quickly Rename, Duplicate, Delete, or reorder it.

**Canvas Controls:**
- **Zoom**: 
    - Hold **Shift** and use your mouse wheel / trackpad.
    - Use the **+** and **-** buttons in the top right.
    - Press **Cmd/Ctrl + Plus/Minus**.
    - Press **Cmd/Ctrl + 0** to fit to screen.
- **Panning**: Hold **Shift** and drag with your mouse, or use two fingers on a trackpad to move the canvas view.
- **Snapping**: Layers will automatically snap to the edges of the canvas and to other layers for perfect alignment.

**Gyro Controls** (Gyro projects only):
A control panel in the bottom-left allows you to simulate device movement.
- **Grid View**: Drag the center knob to simulate tilt.
- **Phone View**: Tilt a virtual 3D phone to see the depth effect.
- **Recenter**: Reset simulation to the neutral position.

### 3. Inspector Panel (Right)

The Inspector Panel shows detailed properties for the selected layer.

**General Tabs (on most layers):**
- **Geometry**: Basic layer properties (position, bounds, rotation, anchor point, etc.)
- **Compositing**: Opacity, corner radius, clip contents
- **Content**: Background color, background opacity, border color, border width
- **Animations**: Keyframe animation settings
- **Gyro**: Configure device tilt effects (Transform Layers only)

<Info>
  Each tab is specific to the layer type. For example, Image layers have an **Image** tab, and Transform Layers have a **Gyro** tab for configuring tilt effects.
</Info>

**Common Properties:**
- **Position (X, Y)**: Layer location on the canvas
- **Bounds (W, H)**: Layer dimensions
- **Rotation (X, Y, Z)**: Layer rotation in degrees
- **Opacity**: Layer transparency
- **Corner Radius**: Rounded corners
- **Background Color**: Layer background fill
- **Border**: Border color and width

<Tip>
  Use the Inspector for precise numeric values. Use the Canvas for quick visual adjustments.
</Tip>

### 4. States Panel (Bottom Left)

The States Panel lets you create a different look for your wallpaper when on different device states, like your device being on the lock screen, home screen, or sleep (off).

**Available States:**
- **Base State**: The default state.
- **Locked**: How the wallpaper looks when your device is on the lock screen.
- **Unlock**: How the wallpaper looks when your device is on the home screen.
- **Sleep**: How the wallpaper looks when your device is off.

**Light/Dark States:**
You can enable **Light/Dark per state** in the States Panel settings (gear icon). This splits the states (e.g., `Locked Light` and `Locked Dark`), allowing you to define different colors and opacities for different iOS appearance modes.

**How It Works:**
1. Select a state (e.g., "Locked").
2. Modify layer properties (position, opacity, etc.).
3. CAPlayground automatically creates smooth transitions between states.

### 5. Timeline Panel (Bottom)

The Timeline Panel provides a visual representation of all animations in your project. It appears automatically when a layer has an animation enabled.

**Features:**
- **Visualize Durations**: See exactly how long each animation lasts.
- **Scrubbing**: Click and drag on the **Time Ruler** at the top of the timeline to see how your animations look at any specific point.
- **Playback Controls**: Use the **Play/Pause** and **Restart** buttons to test your animations.
- **Zooming**: Use the **+** and **-** buttons in the timeline header to change the time scale (zoom in for precision, zoom out for the big picture).
- **Label Resizing**: Drag the divider between the layer names and the tracks to adjust the width of the label column.

### 6. Device Preview (Canvas Shortcut)

Click the **Phone Icon** (bottom-left area of the canvas) to enter **Device Preview** mode. This simulates how your wallpaper will look and behave on a real device.

- **Interactive States**: Swipe up from the bottom to "unlock" the phone, or swipe down from the status bar area to "lock" it.
- **Depth Effect Toggle**: Test how your layers interact with the lock screen clock.
- **Theme Toggle**: If you have enabled Light/Dark states, use the **Sun/Moon** toggle to switch appearance modes.
- **Sleep Simulation**: Click the side button to toggle the Always-On Display (Sleep) state.

---

## Menu Bar (Top)

The menu bar provides quick access to important functions:

- **Project Name**: Shows the current project name (click to rename). This is a dropdown that also lets you go back to the Projects page, rename your project, or delete your project.
- **Undo/Redo**: Undo (Cmd/Ctrl+Z) and Redo (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Z)
- **Settings**: Configure editor preferences (snapping options, keyboard shortcuts, etc.)
- **Export**: Export your wallpaper as .CA zip file or .tendies file (Cmd/Ctrl+E)
- **Save Status**: Auto-saves to your device (You can manually save by hovering over the status)

---

## Editor Settings

Click the **Settings** (gear icon) in the top menu to customize your environment:

- **UI Modes**:
    - **Default Mode**: The standard interface with full-sized panels and icons.
    - **Compact UI**: Toggle this to shrink the interface, giving you more room for the Canvas. Perfect for laptop screens or smaller monitors.
- **Snapping**: Enable or disable snapping to edges and other layers to help with alignment.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: View and customize shortcuts for various editor actions.
