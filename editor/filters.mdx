Filters allow you to apply real-time post-processing effects to any layer. Unlike the permanent editing tools (like the image crop or blur), filters are **non-destructive**—you can change their values at any time without affecting the original asset.


## Using Filters

1. Select any layer on the canvas.
2. Open the **Filters** tab in the Inspector panel.
3. Click **Add Filter** and choose an effect from the dropdown.
4. Adjust the **Value** slider to change the intensity of the effect.

## Supported Filter Types

| Filter | Description | Value Unit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gaussian Blur** | Blurs the layer evenly in all directions. | Radius (px) |
| **Hue Rotate** | Shifts the colors of the layer along the color wheel. | Angle (deg) |
| **Saturate** | Increases or decreases color intensity. | Multiplier |
| **Contrast** | Adjusts the difference between light and dark areas. | Multiplier |
| **Sepia** | Applies a warm, antique brown tone. | Intensity (0-1) |
| **Invert** | Flips all colors to their opposites (negative effect). | Toggle |

## Managing Filters

- **Order Matters**: Filters are applied from top to bottom. A "Hue Rotate" applied after a "Sepia" will look different than if the order were reversed.
- **Toggle Visibility**: Click the checkbox next to a filter's name to temporarily disable it.
- **Multiple Filters**: You can add the same filter multiple times to stack effects.
- **Delete**: Click the trash icon to remove a filter entirely.

<Warning>
  **Performance Note:** Adding many complex filters (especially Gaussian Blur) to multiple layers can impact performance on older devices. Use them where necessary, but avoid overusing them on large, high-resolution layers.
</Warning>
