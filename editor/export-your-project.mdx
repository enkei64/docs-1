To export your project, click the **Export** button in the top menu or press `Cmd/Ctrl + E`.

## Export Formats

You can choose from the following formats:

- **.tendies**: The recommended format for daily use. This file can be applied directly to your iOS device using **Pocket Poster** or **Nugget**. Check out the [Pocket Poster Guide](https://pocketposter.squair.xyz/) for setup instructions.
- **.CA**: A project interchange format. This is useful for sharing your project with others so they can open and edit it in CAPlayground. It *cannot* be applied as a wallpaper directly.
