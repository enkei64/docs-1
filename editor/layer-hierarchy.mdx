Layer hierarchy allows you to organize your wallpaper into a structured tree of layers and sublayers, making complex projects easier to manage.

## Understanding Layer Hierarchy

### What is a Layer Hierarchy?

A layer hierarchy is a parent-child relationship between layers:
- **Parent layers** can contain **child layers** (called **sublayers**)
- Sublayers inherit transformations from their parent layer
- Sublayers can be nested multiple levels deep

<Info>
  In CAPlayground, there are no dedicated "group" layers. Any layer can act as a parent and contain sublayers.
</Info>

**Example hierarchy:**
```
Root Layer
├─ Background Container (Basic Layer - opacity 0%, acts as a container)
│  ├─ Gradient Layer
│  └─ Image Layer
└─ Content Container (Basic Layer - opacity 0%, acts as a container)
   ├─ Title Text
   └─ Icons Container (Basic Layer - opacity 0%)
       ├─ Icon 1
       ├─ Icon 2
       └─ Icon 3
```

## Creating Sublayers

### How to Add Sublayers

To create a sublayer inside an existing layer:

1. **Select the parent layer** in the Layers Panel or Canvas
2. Click **Add Layer** and choose a layer type
3. The new layer will be created as a sublayer of the selected layer

<Tip>
  If no layer is selected, new layers are created at the root level.
</Tip>


### Removing Sublayers

To move a sublayer back to the root level:

1. **Drag the sublayer** from the Layers Panel
2. **Drop it** outside its parent (above or below other root layers)
3. The layer becomes a root layer again

## Using Sublayers that act like a Container

### What Are Containers?

Since any layer can have sublayers, you can create a so called **container layer** to organize related elements:

**Common approaches:**
- Create a **Basic Layer** and set its **opacity to 0%** to make it invisible
- Create a **Transform Layer (CATransformLayer)** for gyro wallpapers
- Add other layers as sublayers
- The container layer acts as a parent

**Why use containers?**
- **Organization**: Group related layers together
- **Batch transformations**: Move multiple layers at once
- **Gyro effects**: Use Transform Layers to make sublayers respond to device tilt

**Example:**
```
Background Container (Basic Layer, opacity 0%)
├─ Gradient Layer
└─ Image Layer
```

**Gyro example:**
```
Transform Layer (for gyro wallpapers)
├─ Image Layer (this layer will respond to device tilt)
```

When you move the container, all sublayers move together. For Transform Layers, sublayers respond to device tilt.

<Info>
  Transform Layers (CATransformLayer) are specialized containers for gyro wallpapers. [Learn more about Gyro Effects →](/layers/transform-layers-gyro) or [Building in 3D →](/layers/transform-layers-3d)

## How Sublayers Inherit Transformations

### Position

Sublayer positions are **relative to their parent**:
- If a parent is at position (100, 100)
- And a sublayer is at position (50, 50)
- The sublayer appears at (150, 150) on the canvas

Moving the parent moves all sublayers with it.

## Advanced Properties

### Flip Geometry

Controls the coordinate system for sublayers:

**Location:** Geometry tab in the Inspector

**Values:**
- **Off**: Bottom-left origin
- **On**: Top-left origin

**What it does:**
- Changes how sublayer positions are calculated
- Affects the Y-axis direction for sublayers
- Useful when importing designs from different coordinate systems

**Example:**
- With Flip Geometry **off**: Y increases upward (0 at bottom)
- With Flip Geometry **on**: Y increases downward (0 at top)

<Info>
  Flip Geometry only affects the layer's sublayers, not the layer itself.
</Info>

### Clip Contents

Controls whether sublayers are clipped to the parent's bounds:

**Location:** Compositing tab in the Inspector

**Values:**
- **Off**: Sublayers can extend beyond the parent's bounds (default)
- **On**: Sublayers are clipped to the parent's bounds

**What it does:**
- When **on**, sublayers are masked to the parent's rectangular area
- Useful for creating "window" effects

**Example:**
```
Container (300x300, Clip Contents: On)
└─ Large Image (500x500) → Only 300x300 visible
```
