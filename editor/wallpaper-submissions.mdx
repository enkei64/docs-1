Once you've created a masterpiece, you can submit it to the official CAPlayground gallery. Every submission is reviewed by the team and, once approved, will be available for everyone to see and download.

## Submission Requirements

Before you submit, ensure your wallpaper meets these requirements:

1. **Originality**: The work must be yours or you must have the rights to use all assets included.

3. **Files**: You will need:
    - Your project's **.tendies** export file.
    - A **Preview Video** (MP4 or MOV) showing the wallpaper in action.
