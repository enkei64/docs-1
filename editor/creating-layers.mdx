Layers are the building blocks of your wallpaper. Each layer represents a visual element like text, shapes, images, or effects.

## How to Create Layers

### Using the Add Layer Button

1. Locate the **Layers Panel** on the left side of the editor
2. Click the **Add Layer** button (with a + icon)
3. Select the type of layer you want to create from the dropdown menu

The new layer will be created and added to your layer list.

### Where Layers Are Created

**By default**, new layers are added:
- **At the top** of the current layer list (in the Base State)
- **As root layers (when no layer is selected)**
- **As sublayers (when a layer is selected)**
- **At the center** of your canvas

<Info>
  Layers higher in the list appear **behind** layers lower in the list. The editor renders them in order, so each new layer in the list is painted on top of the previous one.
</Info>

### Creating Sublayers (a layer inside another layer)

To create a layer as a **sublayer** inside a layer:

1. Select an existing layer you want the sublayer to be created in
2. Create a new layer
3. The layer will become a child of the layer

<Tip>
  Putting layers inside other layers help you organize related elements and apply transformations to multiple layers at once!

### Basic Layer (Shape)

A layer that displays geometric shapes like rectangles, circles, and rounded rectangles.

**Best for:**
- Backgrounds and containers
- Decorative elements
- Solid background for a wallpaper

**Key features:**
- Three shape types: Rectangle, Circle, Rounded Rectangle

### Gradient Layer

A layer that displays smooth color gradients.

**Best for:**
- Backgrounds
- Color overlays
- Visual effects

**Key features:**
- Three gradient types: Axial (linear), Radial, Conic
- Multiple color stops
- Adjustable start and end points
- Opacity per color

### Image Layer

A layer that displays an image from your computer or a web link.

**Best for:**
- Photos and illustrations
- Logos and icons
- Textures and patterns

**Key features:**
- Supports PNG, JPEG, SVG
- Multiple fit modes (cover, contain, fill, none)
- Drag and drop & Link Import support
- SVG automatic PNG conversion

**How to create:**
1. Click **Add Layer** → **Image Layer…** (to upload) or **Import from Link**.
2. Select your file or paste a URL.

<Info>
  You can drag and drop images directly onto the canvas to create image layers quickly!
</Info>

### Video Layer

A layer that displays an animated video or GIF.

**Best for:**
- Animated backgrounds
- Moving elements
- GIF animations

**Key features:**
- Supports video files and GIFs
- Maximum 30 fps recommended
- Maximum 12 seconds duration recommended
- Auto-reverse and Loop options

**How to create:**
1. Click **Add Layer** → **Video Layer…** or **Import from Link**.
2. Select a file or paste a URL.
3. The video will be processed and added to your project.

<Warning>
  Video layers are very resource-intensive. Use them sparingly for best performance.
</Warning>

### Emitter Layer

A layer that creates particle effects like snow, rain, sparkles, and more.

**Best for:**
- Particle effects
- Animated backgrounds
- Environmental atmosphere

**Key features:**
- Multiple emitter shapes (point, line, rectangle, circle, etc.)
- Customizable particles (emitter cells)
- Particle properties (velocity, lifetime, scale, rotation, etc.)

### Replicator Layer

A layer that duplicates a single "source" layer into many copies with offsets in position, rotation, and scale.

**Best for:**
- Creating grids of items
- Circular patterns
- Complex geometric designs

**Key features:**
- Instance count and delay
- Translation, rotation, and scale offsets per instance
- Automatic layout updates

### Liquid Glass Layer

A layer that creates a realistic glass refraction (distortion) effect on layers behind it.

**Best for:**
- Frosted glass effects
- Magnifying lenses
- Modern "glassmorphism" UI

**Key features:**
- Distorts any layers positioned behind it
- Adjustable Strength and Depth
- Optional Chromatic Aberration (color fringing)

<Warning>
  Liquid Glass only renders in Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge). It will work on your iOS device once exported.
</Warning>

### Transform Layer (CATransformLayer)

A special container layer for gyro wallpapers that makes sublayers respond to device tilt and enables 3D depth.

**Best for:**
- Gyro wallpapers with parallax effects
- Building 3D objects like cubes

## Layer Organization

### Layer Order

The order of layers in the Layers Panel determines their visual stacking:
- **Top of the list** = **Back** of the wallpaper (appears behind)
- **Bottom of the list** = **Front** of the wallpaper (appears on top)

**To reorder layers:**
1. Click and drag a layer in the Layers Panel
2. Drop it above or below other layers
3. A blue line shows where the layer will be placed

<Info>
  Currently, you cannot create empty group layers directly. Create layers first, then organize them into groups by dragging.
</Info>

## Layer Limits

### Performance Considerations

- **Keep it simple**: More layers = more processing power required
- **Optimize images**: Use appropriate image sizes (don't use 4K images if not needed)
- **Limit video layers**: Video layers are the most resource-intensive
- **Limit emitter layers**: Particle effects can impact performance

<Tip>
  Test your wallpaper on your device early and often to ensure good performance!
