Currently, you can only create the animations that are supported, shown below:

- Keyframe Animations

## Keyframe Animations

Keyframe animations have a keypath, duration, settings for repeat, and values.

### Getting Started

**To create a keyframe animation:**

1. Select a layer in your canvas
2. Open the **Animations** tab in the Inspector panel (right side)
3. Toggle **Enable animation** to ON
4. Configure your animation settings (see below)

**Note:** You must be on the **Base State** to create animations. Animations cannot be created or edited in other states.

**Note:** Animations are not supported for video layers.

### Animation Settings

#### Key path

Click the **Key path** dropdown to select what type of animation you want to create for your layer. Available options:

- **position** - Both X and Y axis position movement
- **position.x** - X axis position movement only
- **position.y** - Y axis position movement only
- **transform.rotation.x** - X axis rotation
- **transform.rotation.y** - Y axis rotation
- **transform.rotation.z** - Z axis rotation

#### Duration (s)

Enter a number in the **Duration (s)** input field to set how long it takes to go from one keyframe (Value) to another. For example, if you set a duration of 1, it will take 1 second to go from your first keyframe to the next.

#### Autoreverse

Toggle the **Autoreverse** switch to make your keyframe animation reverse after finishing the last keyframe. This means if you have 5 keyframes, it will go from 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 1.

#### Loop Infinitely

Toggle the **Loop infinitely** switch to control how your animation repeats:

- **When turned ON**: Your animation will repeat forever.
- **When turned OFF**: An input field **Repeat for (s)** will appear. Enter the total duration the animation should play before stopping.

#### Values

The **Values** section is where you create the keyframes for your animation. The input fields shown depend on your selected **Key path**:

- For **position**: You'll see X and Y input fields for each keyframe
- For **position.x** or **position.y**: You'll see a single number input for each keyframe
- For **transform.rotation** keypaths: You'll see a Degrees input for each keyframe

**To add a keyframe:**
1. Click the **+ Add key value** button
2. Enter the value(s) for that keyframe in the input field(s)
3. Repeat to add more keyframes

**To remove a keyframe:**
Click the **Remove** button next to the keyframe you want to delete.

**Important:** You MUST have at least 2 values to see an animation.

#### Advanced Animation Settings

Expand the **Advanced** section in the Animations tab to access more control:

- **Calculation Mode**: 
    - **Paced**: Smooth, even movement across all keyframes.
    - **Discrete**: Instant jumps between keyframes (great for blinking or stop-motion).
- **Timing Function**: Control the "acceleration" of your animation:
    - **Linear**: Constant speed.
    - **Ease In**: Starts slow, then speeds up.
    - **Ease Out**: Starts fast, then slows down.
    - **Ease In/Out**: Starts and ends slow.
- **Key Times**: (Advanced) Manually specify the percentage of duration (0.0 to 1.0) when each keyframe should be reached.

## The Timeline

The **Timeline** at the bottom of the editor provides a visual way to manage your animations.

- **Syncing**: Align animations across different layers.
- **Quick Adjust**: Click and drag the ends of an animation bar in the timeline to change its **Duration** without typing numbers.
